# UFOs
## Overview of the UFOs
### Purpose of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by applying multiple filters at the same time to look for the desired UFO incidents.

we created a html document that design the layout, titles, background, and wording, etc. Also, we added our javascript functions as app.js in the html document. We created the function to loop through the data and find the desired data that user is looking for.

We also stored all the data in data.js, so we can find our data from html by adding script.



## Results


As picture shown above, this is the home page of the UFOs webpage. There is a short description of the project and also a table contains all the data at the bottom.



We can apply filter in our search for the specific UFO incident we want to see. For example, we can enter the shape of the UFO, the date, or the city, etc.



We can go back to our home page anytime by clicking navbar on top left.





## Summary


For drawback:

1. There is no message box if user enter a wrong information in filter. Some user may not know what they can enter on the filter box. 

2. Filter is case sensitive. For example, if user enter "PA", or "pA" on State, the user cannot get the correct result.


There are two recommendations for further development

1. On the table column, we can add a link for each case that can be a news, images, or evidence that related to the incident. It can bring the user experience to a higher level and will be more convincing.

2. we can have one more filter for Duration. For example, we can create a drop-down filter such as "Less than 1 minute, 1-to-5-minute, 5 minute or more"
